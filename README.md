## Project Summary

### Overview 
Fluff Finder is the perfect website for any pet lovers in Singapore! The site's primary feature is an interactive map, enabling users to discover various pet-friendly locations in Singapore. The website allows for the seamless discovery of any pet-related locales in Singapore: Pet Cafés, Pet Groomers, Pet Supplies Stores, and Dog Parks. By displaying the name and address of each individual location on the map, users can identify locations they would like to learn more about or even travel to with ease. Each location category is also separated via different icons, enabling easy differentiation between the various locations the map displays.

The site also features a relaxing second page where users can enjoy randomly-generated images of dogs!

### Target Audience & User Goals

All in all, the main goal of the website is to assist Singaporeans in finding any relevant locations for their pets. This website will be useful for any dog & cat owners in Singapore, as many animal-friendly locations fly under the radar and can be quite difficult to pinpoint. As an example, it is relatively common for dog owners to ask online groups about where they can discover new and fun dog-friendly locations, especially dog cafés. Generally, no one memorizes a list of every single mall that allows dogs. Sometimes, you just want to go for a nice outing and enjoy the company of your pet, but limited information makes this task a bit more difficult.

Fluff Finder enables easy and near-instantaneous access to crucial information - such as names and addresses - about any relevant areas & services pet owners might require. Ultimately, this saves users time and hassle, enriching the overall experience for all pet owners and their fluffy friends!

## UI/UX Elements

### Structure

### Design Decisions

#### Color Scheme
![Color Scheme image](assets/resources/color-palette.jpg)

The main color scheme of the project revolves around a light background (a beige-wheat gradient), with a lavender accent for the header. The items within the main content box are backed by a smooth snowy base. These light colors evoke a sense of calm and tranquility, while maintaining an elegant touch. Light colors are also easy on the eyes, avoiding any jarring effects and creating an affable atmosphere. The lavender color also represents a sense of elegance and sophistication. Mint green highlighting is also used to directly complement the lavender header color. All in all, these colors come together to present the website in a professional yet friendly manner.

#### Fonts

- *Play* is a minimalistic typeface that has been designed to appear both square and circular at the same time. Each letter derives from the letter 'O' - which allows for a sense of balance and interconnectedness. This was chosen as the primary font of the website, allowing for a friendly and sleek overall appearance for the user, with the text being very legible and easy on the eyes.
- *Unbounded* was selected as the font for the main Fluff Finder header on the website. While it is a bold and courageous font in its own right, it's also capable of accounting for hundreds of languages worldwide, as well as countless symbols and glyphs. This resultantly gives the header a strong and stylish appearance, while retaining its universality. 
- *Carter One* is a font that reimagines popular typeforms from the mid-20th century. As it was frequently found in advertising and book covers, it enables text to have a bold, distinct appearance. It was chosen as the font for the navigation bar elements, distinguishing them from the other text elements on the page and helping them stand out.

All in all, the selected fonts are directly in-line with the goal of making the website very warm and friendly to the user, while maintaining a clean and professional feeling.

## Features

| Features | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Search for pet-friendly locations | This search feature enables users to search for various pet-friendly locations, with the ability to fine-tune their search by entering a name, selecting a category, and choosing the number of results (from 10-50) to display. Every time a successful search is completed, all previous results will be cleared from the map. This functions by matching the selected parameters of the search to the results from the data set, with said results being extracted for processing later on. |
| Display locations as markers & show location information | Search results are displayed as markers on the map, being easily-accessible by simply clicking on them. Markers are 'clustered' into individual groups based on their categories, and each cluster is organized into its own layer. Upon user click, the marker will display a popup with location information: name, type of location, and exact address. The map will also fly to each marker whenever one is clicked. |
| Display search results | All search results are displayed in a formatted list that is shown on a side panel, which is toggleable with a button. Upon clicking on a search result, the map will zoom to the corresponding marker on the map, opening its popup to display information. | 
| Map controls | The map has controls to zoom in and out of the map, as well as a toggleable controller to hide and show any of the category layers at the user's discretion. | 
| Subscription form | The website features a subscription form, enabling the user to submit their email to receive special updates pertaining to the website. This form has been designed with a few validation rules, which prevent invalid inputs from being submitted. Note: the form submission does not have backend functionality, due to the scope of the project. | 
| Display randomly-generated dog images | The website's second functional page features two card components with dog facts. The refresh button on the page allows the user to update the cards to display a newly-randomized dog image. |

## Limitations and Future Implementations
- Search by user query is rather inaccurate, as FourSquare's search by query has some limitations
    - Solution: consider using another API, such as OneMap, for more accurate data retrieval based on location-specific searches
- Marker results displayed aren't fully confined to Singapore, and sometimes bleed over into Malaysia
    - Solution: consider utilizing the FourSquare radius function to limit the search to Singapore's geographical boundaries.
- Randomized dog images have some issues: their height doesn't perfectly match the parent container, and sometimes an invalid file format is returned, causing the feature to break
    - Solution: consider adding more styling rules to better match the image to the parent container, as well as implement further validation rules to only pass in selected image file formats
- More pages were planned, but aren't implemented for the website yet
    - Animal Statistics page: could display data using charts
    - About Us & Contact Us pages

## Technologies Used

1. HTML

2. CSS

3. [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/)
  - Was used for many of the main website components, including the navbar, forms, buttons, and offcanvas functionality. Bootstrap was also utilized as the primary means of implementing mobile-responsiveness for the website.

4. JavaScript

5. [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)
  - Used for fetching relevant data from APIs to be processed for the website

6. [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/)
  - Used for creating and rendering the interactive map on the website

7. [Leaflet Marker Cluster](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.markercluster)
  - Used for grouping markers on the map into clusters

## Testing
| Test Case | Steps | Expected Result |
| ----------- | -----------  | ----------- |
| User searches for results | Select parameters, click on search button | Various markers display on the map |
| User inputs erroneous search data | Input invalid data in the results field: special characters or numbers out of the 10-50 range | Error validation and displaying of an error message the map update form |
| User opens search results pane | Click on search results button after a successful search | Search canvas slides into the page, displaying results in a formatted list |
| User randomizes dog image | Click on refresh button | A new image is appended to the card |
