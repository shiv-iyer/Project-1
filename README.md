# Fluff Finder

Fluff Finder is the perfect website for any pet lovers in Singapore! The site's primary feature is an interactive map, enabling users to discover various pet-friendly locations in Singapore. 

## Project Summary & Goals

(talk about project overview / summary)
Fluff Finder allows for the seamless discovery of any pet-related locales in Singapore: Pet Cafes, Pet Groomers, Pet Supplies Stores and Dog Parks. By displaying the name and address of each individual location on the map, <>. Each location category is also separated via different icons, enabling easy differentiation between the various locations it displays.

(talk about target audience)
All in all, the main goal of the website is to assist Singaporeans in finding any relevant locations for their pets. As some of these can be quite difficult to find for the average pet owner, Fluff Finder enables easy and near-instantaneous access to crucial information about any areas & services they might require for their pets. Ultimately, this saves users time and hassle, enriching the overall experience for all pet owners and their fluffy friends!

Some more pain points: very difficult to find dog-friendly locations in SG, resources are limited, pet owners always asking online groups etc. Singapore is generally relatively dog friendly but lots of malls / shops etc. don't allow, so need to locate specific sometimes (especially rarer things like cafes)

## UI/UX Elements

### Structure
(wireframe... hmm...)

### Design Decisions

#### Color Scheme
(display colors of the website and the goal of them - what kind of feel / vibe do they give?)

#### Fonts

- *Play* is a minimalistic typeface that has been designed to appear both square and circular at the same time. Each letter derives from the letter 'O' - which allows for a sense of balance and interconnectedness. This was chosen as the primary font of the website, allowing for a friendly and sleek overall appearance for the user, with the text being very legible and easy on the eyes.
- *Unbounded* was selected as the font for the main Fluff Finder header on the website. While it is a bold and courageous font in its own right, it's also capable of accounting for hundreds of languages worldwide, as well as countless symbols and glyphs. This resultantly gives the header a strong and stylish appearance, while retaining its universality. 
- *Carter One* is a font that reimagines popular typeforms from the mid-20th century. As it was frequently found in advertising and book covers, it enables text to have a bold, distinct appearance. It was chosen as the font for the navigation bar elements, distinguishing them from the other text elements on the page and helping them stand out.

All in all, the selected fonts are directly in-line with the goal of making the website very warm and friendly to the user, while maintaining a clean and professional feeling.
